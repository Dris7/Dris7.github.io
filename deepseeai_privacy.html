    <p>Please note that we are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not collect or store any personal data without your explicit consent. Keystroke data is used locally on your device to improve typing accuracy and is not transmitted to our servers unless you opt-in to specific features that require such data.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the app may request permissions related to DeepSeeAI to ensure optimal performance of its features. DeepSeeAI-related permissions are essential for providing you with personalized experiences and accessing specific functionalities within the app. Please be assured that we handle your data per our privacy policy and do not collect or store any personal information without your consent.</p>

    <p>We assure users that any user data obtained through these permissions will not be shared or distributed without the user's express consent, except as required by law. We take the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and are committed to complying with all relevant data protection laws and regulations.</p>

    <p>You can read more about the details of our Privacy Policy in the following sections.</p>

                Please note that all third parties that are engaged in processing user data are service providers that use such information on the basis of an agreement and pursuant to a business purpose.

            <li><strong>How long will input data be retained?</strong><br>
                To protect your privacy, we ensure that all Input Data processed through our app is automatically deleted immediately after the processing is completed. Our commitment to privacy protection remains steadfast, providing you with peace of mind when using our services.

        <h2>14. Retention</h2>
        <p>We store information for as long as necessary for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy, including to provide our Services, or for other legitimate purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, or protecting or defending our rights, property, and users. The storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis that depends on the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The nature of the information and why it is collected and processed. The length of time we will keep your information will generally be determined by how long we need that information to provide you with our Services, including any optional features you use, and to provide customer support.</li>
            <li>In certain cases, we need to keep your information for longer for legal reasons as described under the Legal Reasons section below.</li>
            <li>Legal Reasons. In certain cases, we also keep your information for legal reasons, including after your account has been deleted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>We keep your information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To respond to a legal request or to comply with applicable law when we have a legal obligation to retain information. For example, if we receive a valid legal request, such as a preservation order or search warrant, related to your account, we preserve your information after you delete your account.</li>
            <li>To deal with and resolve requests and complaints. For example, we generally retain correspondence relating to data subject requests under GDPR for a year, in case those requests are not resolved and this correspondence is required in order to handle any resulting complaints. In such cases, the correspondence is then retained while those complaints are being resolved.</li>
            <li>For litigation or regulatory matters. For example, we preserve your information where it is reasonably necessary for reasons related to a legal claim or complaint, such as where we are subject to a regulatory investigation or we need to defend ourselves in legal proceedings about a claim related to your information or respond to a regulator in relation to a complaint made by you or someone else.</li>
            <li>Issues relating to the safety, security, and integrity of our Services and to protecting rights, property, and users. For example, we keep information where it is necessary to investigate misuse of our Services, such as spam and other bad experiences. If we disable an account for violating our Terms, we also preserve information about that user for safety, security, and integrity purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The actual information that we keep and how long we keep it for depends on the nature of the reason in question.</p>

        <h2>18. Special Notice to Individuals in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and/or the United Kingdom</h2>
        <p>This section only applies to individuals that access or use our Service while located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom (collectively, the “Designated Countries”) at the time of data collection. We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in.</p>

        <p>When we rely on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this section to any individual that masks or otherwise hides their location information from us so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to users in the Designated Countries.</p>

        <h3>A. Our Relationship to You</h3>
        <p>DeepSeeAI is a data controller with regard to any personal information collected from individuals accessing or using its Service. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that act as our service providers or are otherwise acting on our behalf are “data processors” that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions.</p>

        <h3>B. Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We describe our legal bases for processing throughout this Policy. Below is a list of the purposes described in our policy with the corresponding legal bases for processing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes;</li>
            <li>Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
            <li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
            <li>Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
            <li>Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In any case, we will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

        <h3>C. Your Individual Rights</h3>
        <p>We provide you with the rights described below when you use our Service. If you would like to exercise your rights under applicable law, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nerdsdev.pro">support@nerdsdev.pro</a>. Please note, we may seek to verify your identity when we receive an individual rights request from you in order to ensure the security of your personal information.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Your Consent:</strong> If we ever asked for your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. A withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of our processing or the processing of any third parties based on consent before your withdrawal.</li>
            <li><strong>Right of Access:</strong> Upon your request, we will provide you with a copy of your personal information in our files without undue delay and free of charge, unless we are permitted by law to charge a fee. Your access may be limited to the extent it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification (or “Correction”):</strong> You may request to correct or update any of your personal information in our files. We may provide you with the ability to update some or all of your personal information directly via the Services.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure (or the “Right to be Forgotten”):</strong> Upon your request, we will erase any of your personal information in our files that: is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; was collected in relation to processing that you previously consented to, but later withdrew such consent; or was collected in relation to processing activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restriction:</strong> You have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information under certain conditions. During the time which restriction of processing applies, we will only process your restricted personal information with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest. We will inform you if or when the restriction is lifted.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may object to our processing at any time and as permitted by applicable law if we process your personal information on the legal bases of: consent; contract; or legitimate interests. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> If we process your personal information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another “controller,” where technically feasible, unless the exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to data portability only applies to personal information provided by you to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Notification to Third Parties:</strong> When we fulfill your individual rights requests for correct (or rectification), erasure, or restriction of processing, we will notify third parties also handling the relevant personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Upon your request, we will identify such third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling:</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless an exception applies under applicable law.</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations to Individual Rights Requests:</strong> We may limit your individual rights requests in the following ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Where denial of access is required or authorized by law;</li>
                    <li>When granting access would have a negative impact on others' privacy;</li>
                    <li>To protect our rights and properties;</li>
                    <li>Where the request is frivolous or burdensome.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transfer of Your Personal Information:</strong> We transfer your personal information subject to appropriate safeguards as permitted under the applicable data protection laws. Specifically, when your personal information is transferred out of the Designated Countries, we have the required contractual provisions for transferring personal information in place with the third parties to which your information is transferred. For such transfers, we rely on legal transfer mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses or we work with U.S.-based third parties that are certified under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Lodge Complaints:</strong> If you believe that we have infringed or violated your privacy rights under applicable law or this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nerdsdev.pro">support@nerdsdev.pro</a>, so that we can work with you to resolve your concerns. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority situated in a Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of alleged infringement.</li>

        <h2>19. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
        <p>Our App is not intended for children. Therefore, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit any personal information from children. For the purposes of this Section, the terms “child” and/or “children” in the context of data processing activities may be interpreted on a case-by-case basis as prescribed by applicable data protection laws. No one who is considered a “child” under applicable data protection laws is allowed to directly provide any personal information to the App.</p>

        <p>As a general rule, we consider a person under the age of 16 to be regarded as “a child” until we have legal grounds to conclude that a person under 16 should be treated as an adult as per provisions of local data protection rules or based on the parent authorization provided to us directly.</p>

        <p>Solely the holders of parental responsibility are liable for preventing their children from providing personal information via the App without relevant verifiable parental consent. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of the holder of parental responsibility for a child, we will erase that information as quickly as possible. If you reasonably believe that we might have any information from or about a child, or a child has directly provided us with personal information via the App without verifiable parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@nerdsdev.pro">support@nerdsdev.pro</a>.</p>
